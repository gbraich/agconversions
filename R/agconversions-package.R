#' Convenient Imperial to Metric Conversion of Agriculture Statistics
#'
#' Are you tired of having to use calculators to convert between acres, hectares, bushels etc.?
#' Figuring out which data to use can get confusing when looking at large agriculture statistics
#' datasets with multiple variables including temperature, area, weight, and application rates.
#'
#' Use these functions to call conversion ratios to your ag statistics. These functions convert some
#' of the most used imperial measurements in agriculture
#' to metric/SI: acres to hectares, acres to sq meters, pounds to metric tonnes,
#' farenheit to celcius and pounds per acre to kilograms per hectare.
