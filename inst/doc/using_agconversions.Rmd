__Note__: This package isn't actually meant to be "serious". I made it just for teaching purposes.

Want to convert agricultural statistics without having to manual change every datapoint or lookup conversion ratios? Checkout the functionality offered by `hectares`, `sqmeters`, `mtonnes`, `celcius` and `kgha` by loading the `agconversions` package! 

```{r}
library(agconversions)
```

Want to get out of the middle ages with acres, pounds and farenheit? Never mess up the temperature or an application rate again. Check out the functions below

```{r}
hectares(100)
mtonnes(20000)
sqmeters(5000)
celcius(32)
kgha(12.5)
```

Wow!!!
